# Next Slices

## Slice: improving prune and refine quality

### Target: prune

I'm still seeing some examples (e.g. examples/v2:de210c2970ed76cf79c27d8cd557214a.png) where the text-detection should ideally be excluding them. I think we can exclude these images by looking at overlap between the text bounding boxes and the 3x3 grid of zones and looking at some features:
1. what %-age of a Zone is taken up by text-boxes (unioned area)?
2. how many Zones have at least some %-age of text-box area?

We can then exclude any images that have > threshold %-age in any Zone, and > number threshold of Zones.

### Target: refine

### Tasks

#### Bugs

* [ ] it seems that docker rust chef based caching is no-longer working i.e. even if library dependencies haven't changed, it still recompiles everything
    1. what's up?
    2. now that docker images are build and named based on git-hash, can we exploit that for a more exact caching of layers?

Rest TBC

## Slice: reducing unintentional bias

### Target

The current skin-detection method in `lib.rs` (Kovac/Peer/Solina 2003 RGB rules + a YCbCr box) is biased toward lighter skin tones. Replace it with a method that performs more fairly across the Fitzpatrick scale, and add tests that would catch this kind of regression in future.

### Tasks

#### Document and demonstrate the current bias
- [ ] Write up the specific lines in `is_skin_pixel` that exclude darker skin:
    - [ ] `r <= 95.0` reject — eliminates much dark brown skin outright
    - [ ] `g <= 40.0` / `b <= 20.0` rejects — fail in shadow and on very dark skin
    - [ ] `(r - g).abs() <= 15.0` reject — absolute R−G gap shrinks at lower intensities even when the ratio is preserved
    - [ ] `max - min <= 15.0` reject — same low-intensity compression problem
    - [ ] note that the YCbCr box is the least-biased part but is ANDed with the RGB gate, so the RGB rules dominate failures
- [ ] Add failing unit tests with known dark-skin RGB samples (e.g. `(80, 50, 35)`, `(60, 40, 30)`, `(110, 75, 55)`) asserting they should be classified as skin — these should fail against the current implementation and pass against the replacement
- [ ] Assemble a small evaluation set of face images spanning Fitzpatrick I–VI and measure per-bucket true-positive rate before and after the change

#### Pick a less-biased method
- [ ] Evaluate options in roughly increasing order of effort:
    - [ ] **CbCr-only elliptical region** (Hsu, Abdel-Mottaleb & Jain, 2002) — drop the RGB gate entirely, fit an ellipse in CbCr space rather than an axis-aligned box. Small code change, big fairness improvement.
    - [ ] **HSV or normalised-rgb thresholds** — hue ≈ [0°, 50°] with moderate saturation and *any* value; removes the luminance dependency that hurts dark skin
    - [ ] **Jones & Rehg statistical skin model** (1999) — Bayesian histogram trained on a large diverse pixel set, runtime is a 3D lookup table, still the standard classical baseline
    - [ ] **Modern ML model trained on a diverse dataset** — anything evaluated on Fitzpatrick 17k or trained on FSD/ECU/Pratheepan; highest accuracy, adds a dependency

#### Rust ecosystem options
- [ ] **Pure-Rust / classical (no new heavy deps).** There is no dedicated "less-biased skin detector" crate on crates.io — closest neighbours are face-detection crates, not skin segmentation. So this path is hand-rolled on top of the existing `image` crate:
    - [ ] Implement a CbCr-ellipse or HSV test directly in `lib.rs`
    - [ ] Optionally fit a Jones-and-Rehg histogram offline against the [UCI Skin Segmentation dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/skin+segmentation) (built from face images "of diversity of age, gender, and race") and ship the resulting lookup table as a `.bin` in the repo
- [ ] **ML model via ONNX.** The standard route for running pretrained vision models from Rust is the [`ort`](https://crates.io/crates/ort) crate (ONNX Runtime bindings). [`rust-faces`](https://crates.io/crates/rust-faces) is a good template for how to wire an ONNX model into a Rust API similar to our `detect_skin` signature.
- [ ] **Candidate model:** [samhaswon/skin_segmentation](https://github.com/samhaswon/skin_segmentation) on GitHub — a benchmark/training repo with ONNX exports of several skin-segmentation models (BiRefNet, U²-Net variants, etc.). The author explicitly built the training set "to maximize diversity of scene, lighting, and skin appearance" with augmentations designed so the model isn't dependent on lighting or camera settings. Caveat: the heaviest BiRefNet variant uses ~40 GB RAM through onnxruntime, so pick one of the smaller CNN models.
- [ ] **Background reading** for evaluation methodology and fairness framing:
    - [ ] [Fitzpatrick 17k](https://github.com/mattgroh/fitzpatrick17k) (Groh et al., 2021) — standard fairness benchmark
    - [ ] [Bencevic et al. (2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260724000403) — quantifies the same bias pattern across U-Net-based skin segmentation models

#### Recommended path
- [ ] **Step 1 — cheap win.** Replace the RGB+CbCr-box rules with either a CbCr ellipse or a Jones-and-Rehg histogram trained on the UCI dataset. Pure Rust, no new heavy deps, almost certainly closes most of the gap. Add the dark-skin unit tests above so the improvement is visible.
- [ ] **Step 2 — only if step 1 isn't good enough.** Add `ort` and load one of the smaller models from samhaswon/skin_segmentation behind an optional feature flag (`features = ["ml"]`), keeping the classical path as the default so the binary stays small.

#### Guardrails
- [ ] Keep the per-Fitzpatrick-bucket eval as a checked-in test or bench so future changes can't silently regress fairness
- [ ] Update the doc-comment on `detect_skin` to honestly describe what the method does and its known limitations

## Slice: replay-based regression testing

### Target

Catch performance and cost regressions before they reach production. The motivating incident is the 26 Apr R2 Class A blowup (see `docs/current-slice.md`): a one-line change in `bc59e99` 10×'d the pruner's LIST rate against R2 and was only caught after deploy by reading Grafana graphs. The shape we want: capture real input traffic for a few minutes, replay the pipeline against a local backend, snapshot the resulting OTel counters, fail the test when any counter moves outside an expected band.

This is **not** deterministic simulation testing in the FoundationDB/TigerBeetle sense — no fake runtime, no concurrency exploration, no fault injection. Just: capture → replay → snapshot → diff.

What it catches:
* R2 op-count regressions (the 26 Apr incident)
* Queue-depth regressions (assert p99 of the depth gauge stays low)
* Throughput cliffs (events processed per simulated minute)
* Anything else expressible as an OTel metric

Out of scope:
* LLM cost regressions
* Concurrency bugs that would need a real DST framework
* Behaviours that only emerge under load longer than the fixture

### Tasks

#### Phase 1: replay infrastructure for pruner

* [ ] make the firehose source pluggable: `firehose::connect` currently returns a concrete `JetstreamReceiver`. Refactor the pipeline to accept any `Stream<Item = JetstreamEvent>` so a JSONL-backed source can drop in
* [ ] add a `capture` CLI that, for a given `--duration`:
    * records firehose events to `tests/fixtures/<name>/firehose.jsonl`
    * snapshots the live R2 store to a tarball at `tests/fixtures/<name>/store.tar`
    * records image HTTP GETs to `tests/fixtures/<name>/images/`
    * keep fixtures small enough to commit; if they grow past a few MB, move to git-lfs or an R2 fixtures bucket
* [ ] write a `replay_pruner` integration test that:
    * extracts the store tarball into a tempdir
    * opens the store via `file://` (existing `StoreArgs::open_store` path) wrapped in `R2MetricsWrapper` — the wrapper produces cost-equivalent counts against local disk
    * serves recorded image responses via [`wiremock`](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/wiremock-rs)
    * drives the JSONL stream into the pluggable firehose source
    * runs until the stream ends, then `force_flush()`s the OTel meter and serialises all counters/gauges (the `InMemoryMetricExporter` pattern in `store_metrics.rs` already shows the shape)
* [ ] assert via a checked-in `expected-metrics.json` with explicit per-counter ranges (e.g. `r2.operations{operation="list"}: 60..120`). Prefer this over `insta`-style auto-blessing — clearer failure messages, no risk of someone blessing a 10× regression by reflex
* [ ] wire into `just test` so it runs in CI

#### Phase 2: extend to live-refine

* [ ] record OpenAI API responses keyed by request hash for the fixture window (wiremock or [`rvcr`](https://github.com/ChorusOne/rvcr))
* [ ] write `replay_live_refine` mirroring the pruner test, asserting both R2 ops and OpenAI request counts

#### Maintenance

* [ ] document how and when to refresh fixtures and the expected-metrics baseline — only when fixtures no longer represent production (e.g. firehose schema change, store schema change), not on every behaviour change
